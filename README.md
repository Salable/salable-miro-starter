## Salable x Miro

This repository is intended to be used as a starting point for building monetised Miro apps with Salable.

The starter code in this repository allows a user to purchase a license for a particular Miro board. Once the board has that license, an "Add Sticky" button allows the user to add a sticky note with "Hello World!" text to the board.

This rudimentary example is intended to showcase the core parts of monetising an app with Salable.

If you want to learn more about Salable, read the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.salable.app/docs/quick-start-guide) and [The Salable Way](https://docs.salable.app/docs/the-salable-way).
